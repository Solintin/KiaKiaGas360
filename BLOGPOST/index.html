                Introduction
            </p>
        </b>
        <div style="color: #474A57;">
            <p>
                The consumption of cooking gas in Nigeria has grown from 110,000MT per annum in 2013 to 400,000MT in
                2016.
                What is the implication of this for the Nigerian entrepreneur? It shows simply, that without a doubt
                that
                the cooking gas business in Nigeria is a risk worth delving into in Nigeria.
            </p>
            <p>Nigeria is well-known as one of the big oil producing countries in the world. It has also been known to
                derive a larger percentage of its revenue from oil. Globally, petroleum products are also thought of as
                an
                aspect of the economy that you can never go wrong with. But among all the petroleum products, gas seems
                to
                be the least thought of in this way. As a matter of fact, statistics conducted some years ago showed
                that
                only about about 5% consumption of the potential of LPG was used in the world.</p>
            <p>But presently, we are seeing changes in the consumption of cooking gas. More people are seeing the
                usefulness
                and convenience of LPG. One of the menaces of the Nigerian society is lack of electricity and although,
                most
                people would prefer to rely on electricity in their kitchens, that preference is not realistic in
                Nigeria. A
                lot of these people therefore substitute their energy use in their kitchens with kerosene. When they
                discover cooking gas however, which is arguably a better alternative to kerosene, they find out not only
                does it cook food faster, but it is also ultimately cheaper.</p>

            <p class="text-primary fw-bold">
                Things to put into consideration
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Get an LPG Business Intelligence Report:</b> Knowledge is universal and is not restricted to any
                particular
                area. If you want to succeed in any endeavour, you are in need of knowledge. As a matter of fact, it is
                advisable that you get knowledge before delving into the business. You should plan before embarking on
                it in
                the first place, knowing the amount of gas plants in the area you want to set up, their average
                turn-around
                time, etc so it will not be a case of a man testing the depth of a river with both feet. Knowledge will
                give
                you insight into the dos and don’ts of the business as you would be learning from the experience of
                people
                before you. And apart from that, knowledge will help you know if you are ready and fully equipped for
                the
                gas business.
            </p>

            <p><b>Land:</b> Apart from the fact that you need a space for your business, in the case of cooking gas, the
                aspect of
                land is even more crucial simply because of the environmental and health implications of cooking gas.
                Therefore, in accordance to the requirement of the DPR (Department of Petroleum Resources), the position
                of
                the plant must be at least 15 meters from any building containing flammable materials; residential
                buildings
                or filling sheds for example. The reason for this is because before you are granted a license (which we
                would be addressing), the DPR would come for inspection and they would need to see this is place before
                your
                application can be approved.</p>
            <p><b> Capital and Labour:</b> There is not a single business that exists for which you don’t need capital
                and
                you would
                need a lot of it for starting cooking gas business, to be candid. This is because you would need to buy
                all
                the
                equipment and these are also some of the things the DPR would look out for prior to granting you a
                license.
                Apart from the DPR needing to see this, you cannot really function without this equipment. It would be
                like
                a
                doctor without a stethoscope. Some of the equipment necessary includes; the testing pool, valve screwing
                equipment, an electronic carousel, a mechanical carousel, electronic scales and mechanical scales among
                others.
                In the same way, you would need to employ several capable hands who would help you operate this
                equipment
                and
                run the business.</p>

            <p>
                <b> Licensing and Permits:</b> This is the stage peculiar to the Nigerian situation as the requirements
                are
                based on
                what has been stipulated by the DPR. The following information would also help in setting up a cooking
                gas
                business.
